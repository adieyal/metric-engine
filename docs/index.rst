Metric Engine Documentation
=============================

**Metric Engine** is a robust Python library designed for precision financial calculations with strong typing, policy-driven behavior, and bulletproof error handling.

Overview
--------

Metric Engine provides a comprehensive foundation for building financial applications that require:

* **Type-safe financial calculations** with units (Money, Ratios, Percentages)
* **Policy-driven formatting** and rounding behavior
* **Null-safe operations** that gracefully handle missing data
* **Extensible calculation registry** for domain-specific financial models
* **Decimal precision** throughout to avoid floating-point errors

Whether you're building accounting software, financial analytics, or business intelligence tools, Metric Engine gives you the building blocks to handle money, percentages, and ratios with confidence.

Key Features
------------

**üè∑Ô∏è Strongly Typed Financial Values**
   Financial values carry their unit type (Money, Ratio, Percent) and policy information, preventing unit mismatches and ensuring consistent formatting.

**üîí Immutable & Safe**
   All operations return new instances. Division by zero and invalid operations return ``None`` instead of crashing, with policy controls for strict vs. lenient behavior.

**üìê Decimal Precision**
   Built on Python's ``Decimal`` type to eliminate floating-point precision issues that plague financial calculations.

**üîß Extensible Calculation Engine**
   Register custom calculations in organized collections. The dependency engine automatically resolves calculation graphs and handles circular dependencies.

**üåê Internationalization Ready**
   Optional Babel integration for currency and percentage formatting in multiple locales.

Quick Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from metricengine import FV
   from metricengine.units import Money, Percent

   # Type-safe financial calculations
   revenue = FV(150000, Money)
   tax_rate = FV(0.25, Percent)  # 25%

   # Safe arithmetic with automatic type handling
   taxes = revenue * tax_rate    # Returns FV[Money]
   net_income = revenue - taxes  # Returns FV[Money]

   print(f"Revenue: {revenue}")           # Revenue: $150,000.00
   print(f"Net Income: {net_income}")     # Net Income: $112,500.00

   # Graceful handling of missing data
   missing_data = None
   safe_calc = revenue * missing_data     # Returns FV.none(), doesn't crash

What Makes It Different
-----------------------

Unlike basic financial libraries, Metric Engine is designed for **production financial software** where correctness, safety, and maintainability are paramount:

* **No silent errors**: Invalid operations return ``None`` or raise clear exceptions
* **Policy consistency**: Rounding, formatting, and error handling follow configurable policies
* **Calculation traceability**: Dependencies between calculations are explicit and validated
* **Framework integration**: Optional Django plugins and extensible architecture
